📊 Final Project
Description of Project
This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data using Power BI to deliver a
comprehensive, interactive overview of the pandemic’s development. By examining essential
parameters—including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and government response indicators,
the project uncovers key trends across countries and over time. After loading and preparing the
dataset, a series of important metrics is calculated, such as active case rate, recovery rate,
mortality rate, infection rate by population, and average Government Response Index.
The dashboard integrates a variety of visualization types, including bar charts, a doughnut chart,
and a line-and-clustered column chart, to provide a high-level summary. Additional report pages
highlight specific perspectives and detailed breakdowns of the global situation such as time-
series patterns, geographic distributions, and government policy responses.
By leveraging Power BI’s interactive features, the project allows users to easily navigate the
data, compare countries, and identify meaningful relationships between case numbers,
population size, and policy actions. Overall, this project not only summarizes the evolving
pandemic situation but also offers valuable insights into how COVID-19 spread and how
different regions responded over time.
